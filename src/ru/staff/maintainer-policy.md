# Maintainer Policy
## Reviews and merging PRs
This does not apply to rule change PRs from the Head Game Admins.

**Before merging any PR that is NOT:**
- A simple bug-fix.
- A small to medium refactor.
- **If in doubt, continue with the procedure and ping anyways.**

You **MUST**:
- Link the PR in [#maint-review-pings](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/1258585578618884167) AND ping any relevant Design Work Groups for review.
If this PR may affect game admins too (rules, rule clarifications, round flow, etc) **all Head Game Admins must be pinged as well.**
  - **If you are not sure, ping Head Game Admins anyways.**
  - It is up to anyone organizing work groups to create a new one if relevant.
    - **If a new work group is created due to this, a further 24 hours are added to this process.**
- The PR must have at least one **Maintainer** approving it, and at least 3 days must have passed since you pinged the relevant Design Groups, and Game Admins if applicable in that channel, with no one dissenting to merging said PR.
- Once the time is up:
  - If no one dissents, the PR can be merged.
  - If there is dissent, the PR author must be notified on GitHub of people's requests for changes and/or arguments against it. You do not need to put a ton of effort in summarizing people's points, simply list opinions as "Maintainer opinion" and "Game Admin opinion".
    - **These opinions must be communicated in a neutral manner, even if you disagree with them.**
  - This is the case even if only one person dissents.
  - Once addressed by the PR author, the process may be started again.
  - If a deadlock is reached where one or more people's dissents cannot be resolved, **a 24-hour-long poll** must be made in the channel with **another @Review Pings + Work Groups + Head Game Admin (if relevant) ping**.
  - At least **75% or more of voters** must agree to it being merged before it does.
    - There is no veto power from any role in the project.
  - If less than 75% of people vote to merge the PR, it must be discussed again and the PR author must be notified.
  - If after another 48 hours no poll reaches 75% or more approvals, the PR may be closed.

**Breaking any of these rules may result in an instant demotion from Maintainer.**
