## Overview

This proposal aims to improve the gameplay cycle of players who enjoy making art and wish to have more impact in the server as a roleplay non-technical role, by adding unique gameplay relevance to it in the round. 
Reviewing briefly: it is suggested that a new item be added, which allows users to paint floor tiles as if they were using a simple raster graphics editor like Microsoft Paint.
This system is supposed to be an improvement upon the crayon mechanics which, currently, greatly limits expression and is very hard to use when making complex artwork.

## Design Pillars

### Inspiring Creativity and Imagination

Artists can evoke joy and play through their work, bringing freshness and providing entertainment and escapism, offering moments of inspiration and wonder in the station's lives.
Art has the power to uplift spirits and provide respite from the challenges of daily spacial life.

### Challenging Norms and Provoking Thought, Social Commentaries

Artists can start difficult discussions with the community/space station crew. Through their art, either by denouncing corrupt leaders, genocides or pointing harsh space living conditions, artists can pave the way to reflection and creative solutions of problems in society.
Artists have the ability to question and even disrupt the status quo, bringing new ideas and new ways of thinking and doing that can impact how players play, discuss and even enjoy the game.
Divergent ideas bring change and change brings new solutions, which can help improve the space station's quality of life.

### Technology as a means, not an end

The artist role is non-technical in nature, however that does not mean that artists can't or shouldn't use any complicated machinery or techniques to achieve desired results.
The new painting item's interface should be simple enough that anyone can become an artist if they so desire, however the artist's role can have a lot of nuance when combined with engineering, chemical or other roles's knowledge.

## Implementation

### General Gameplay

The Visual Artist's entire gameplay will revolve around making visual representations on floor tiles or by using other techniques from other roles specialties (for example, architectural decor).

The new item will be a color palette which can be mixed for 'infinite' color results, much like a color picker in standard graphics editors.
The system will be implemented using RGB standards and the palette's fuel will be depleted 'continuously' using a amount of pixels colored colored metric.
When the amount of pixels colored reaches a certain number, the color palette becomes depleted and a new palette must be bought or crafted in order for new paintings to be made.
The Visual Artist will start with one Artistic Toolbox, containing a box of crayons and a color palette.
The Visual Artist will also start with a unique set of clothing, which inspires creativity and makes it clear to players which role they selected at game start.

### Gameplay cycle

The whole gameplay of the Visual Artist can be roughly divided into 3 parts:

1) Expression through visual representations in floor tiles or through other means (e.g. architectural decor)
2) Interacting with crew and empathizing with their daily lives and tasks
3) Making social commentaries through their art

### Crafting Palette
