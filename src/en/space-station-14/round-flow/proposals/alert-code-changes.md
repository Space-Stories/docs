## Overview

This proposal suggests changes to alert codes, expected procedures related to them, gameplay implications of having active alert codes and how will that influence the overall round flow. The main departments affected by this design document are security and command.

## Background

This discussion in Discord is a discussion about revolutionaries, crew morale and implications from these mechanics: https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/770682801607278632/1258800014205915157

## Problems

Here are the main problems with current alert system:

- There is no reason to not go blue/red as soon as round starts, except from theoretical bwoink. Blue gives security a free pass to search everyone on demand and bolt doors to head offices/high-security areas.
- Emergency codes do not have a persistent structure. Green/Blue/Red follow the order of how bad the situation overall is, but Yellow and Violet do not follow that: instead, they tell *what* the emergency is.
- There are no in-game implications for being on high alert. This is related to point 1, but it also results in emergency level rarely going down during the round.

## New Code Procedure

I suggest to change alert codes to a type-based system. Every alert code points out *what* is the problem, not the severity of it.

Additionally, it should be possible to set multiple alert codes.

This change aims to result in the following changes:

- Minor crimes no longer justify blue alert, since these do not confirm syndicate activity. Instead, security is encouraged to deal with problems more peacefully and confront only those related to the minor crime;
- Upon checking current emergencies, crew can easily understand the actions they are supposed to take as their role;
- This also makes emergency responses quicker, because command members do not require to type out the emergency in a broadcast anymore (that is just what is happening currently anyway).

## Emergency Implications

Different emergencies would unlock different things across the station. In some cases, it aims to help crew; in some cases, it aims to help security and command, but also potentially worsen the situation if codes were declared without a good need for it.

- Yellow/Cyan automatically sets EVA to emergency access. If there is no actual engineering emergency, EVA is only going to add problems to security, since breaking in from space is usually easier;
- Blue/Red blocks station passive income (no NT investments until emergency is resolved) and disables random supplies from CC. Instead, security+cargo may work together to sell contraband to CentComm for extra spesos(basically liquidating it);
- Red grants security soft All-Access(equal to HoP access). This may seem like a direct upside, but if Red is called in case of non-emergency, it actually benefits the antagonists: they can now kill a single secoff for AA;
- Specific emergencies unlock specific locked crates: any heavy arms emergency opens armory for security, any virus emergency opens the bio suit crates and lockers, etc;
- Any kind of emergency except Lime/admemergency for extended time results in crew morale reduction time (explained further on).

## Crew Morale

Crew Morale (referred to as CM further on) is a hidden value that serves as a counter-measure to command and security running the station badly (referred to as BadHeading).

CM is supposed to be not metagameable, unless it is very low. This means that unique events should only be occuring when CM is very low.

High CM grants more positive events such as cool supplies from CC. Low CM results in negative stuff happening, up to a revolution.

**WARNING:** all parts of this doc mentioning a revolution imply that Revs were redesigned in a way shifting them to a less round-ending threat.

CM is not caused by crew directly (in most cases); it is caused by badheading/goodheading. Examples:

- Mass crew death results in CM drop;
- Creating amenities for crew results in CM raise (organising a pizza party or a concert);
- Prolonged alert codes being active drop CM based on their severity;
- Apprehending people that did not do things considered as harmful/hostile (slipping, stealing high-value things, harming people) results in CM drop. Important: **under no circumstances** should this be a simple antag check (security should not be punished for dealing with shitters);
- Lack of any action on things that the station needs causes CM drops (ex. TONS of messes);
- If CM is lower than default and no CM drops were triggered in a long while, CM will go up to default value.
- Certain critical events (such as singuloose or nukies) should disable CM system, since at this point station is already overwhelmed.

Some of the triggered event examples:

- Low CM can trigger a random minor negative event (skeleton spawn, vent creatures etc);
- Very low CM can trigger a head revolutionary spawning (please read the warning above);
- Very low CM can trigger a termination of a head from their position via CC announcement. Heads of departments that contributed to CM drop are picked when possible (for example, if "tons of messes" contributed to CM hitting "very low" threshold, HoP will be fired). This is not enforceable directly, but is rather aimed to create IC conflict between crew and command, as well as alerting crew of badheading occuring;
- High CM can trigger a random minor positive event (CC gifts, additional cargo funds etc).
