## Overview

As we have discussed in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/311537926376783886/1258727306889793666) (where this was given *great* feedback), the Revolutionaries gamemode is currently in a state of limbo; often criticized as the worst gamemode by some due to the issues of power-gaming and meta-gaming that are involved, while others consider it one of the best gamemodes because of the fun and stories it can produce. This proposal aims to address the challenges related to meta-gaming and power-gaming, while also enhancing the overall enjoyment of the Revolutionaries gamemode.

## Conversion Rework:

- Instead of flashes, **Head Revolutionaries** are given a two new actions (like screaming, toggling harm mode). One of which will "spread propaganda" to everyone in a four-tile radius around them filling up 15% of the **Conversion Bar** (10% they are mindshielded), while the other one will "spread propoganda" to ONE person, filling up a whopping 50% of their **Conversion Bar** (75% if they are mindshielded). Both these abilities will be linked together with a cooldown. This cooldown will start off at 30 seconds, but scale up by 10 for every converted **Revolutionary**.
- Everyone has a hidden **Conversion Bar**, only seen by **Head Revolutionaries**. Once this bar is filled, one of two things will happen:
  1. **If the person IS NOT mindshielded**, they will be converted into a **Revolutionary**.
  2. **If the person IS mindshielded**, they will be notified of the spreading of **Revolutionary** propaganda.

## Revolutionary Objectives:

- Instead of all **Revolutionaries** having the united goal of eliminating or restraining all **members of Command**, they may now have separate goals.
- **PERSON SPECIFIC** examples of what some may be:
  - *Ensure that [head of department] is eliminated.* <sup>1</sup>
  - *Ensure that [head of department] remains alive, but restrained.* <sup>1</sup>
  - *Ensure that [% of command members] are eliminated or restrained.* <sup>1</sup>
  - *Seize control of the station.* (At least 90% of all remaining on-station after Evac are converted.) <sup>2</sup>
  - *Convert at least [%] of [department that isn't Security].* <sup>2</sup>
  - *Ensure that [person, IS mindshielded] is converted.* (Requires adding a way to remove mindshields.)
  - *Ensure that [person, IS NOT mindshielded] is converted.*
  - *Convert at least [%] of the station.* <sup>2</sup>
- **GLOBAL** examples would be:
  - *Ensure that the Captain of the station is eliminated or restrained.*
  - *Make sure the Deed to the Station is in Revolutionary possession.* (Requires adding a new item to the game.)
  - *Survive until the end of the shift.*

  *Things that are marked with specific numbers are mutually exclusive.
- Whenever a **Revolutionary** is converted, they will inherit the objective to ensure that the **Head Revolutionary** that converted them has all their own objectives completed.

## Possible Ideas:

- Different **Head Revolutionaries** have different objectives, possibly leading towards seperate **Revolutionaries** having conflicting goals.
- **Head Revolutionaries** are no longer known to other **Head Revolutionaries** (perhaps they could be given a codeword system?).
- **Revolutionaries** are no longer known to other **Revolutionaries**, except by the **Head Revolutionary** who converted them.
- If a **Head Revolutionary** dies, all those who were converted by them will retain their **Revolutionary** status to prevent **Security** from only going after the **Head Revolutionaries**.
- Posters and/or banners created by **Head Revolutionaries** may also be used to fill the **Conversion Bar**.
  - Posters and banners created and placed by **Head Revolutionaries** will slowly increase the **Conversion Bar** of any and all players around them to a maximum of 25%, at the rate of 0.5% per second.


## Other:

- Pros (including **Possible Ideas**):
  1. Flashes can no longer be meta-gamed.
  2. **Revolutions** are now much quieter than before, as well as being far less lethal.
  3. Some **Head Revolutionaries** cannot work together due to conflicting objectives.
  4. Multiple players can be converted into a **Revolutionary** at once.
  5. There are now possibilities of "Departmental **Revolutions**" instead of stationwide **Revolutions**.
  6. The crew now have ways to sniff out or suspect a **Revolution** without meta-gaming.
  7. There is now much more RP opportunity in the process of turning into a **Revolutionary**.

- Cons (including **Possible Ideas**):
  1. Posters and banners can be somewhat used to metagame the existance of a **Revolution**.
  2. Some players may intentionally seek out these posters and banners to antag-roll (though they still require the assistance of a **Head Revolutionary** to become a **Revoltutionary**.
  3. Converting players into **Revolutionaries** is a more time-consuming process.
  4. Glasses no longer protect against conversion into a **Revolutionary**.
  5. Converted **Revolutionaries** no longer know the identities of other **Revolutionaries**.
